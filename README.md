## Biography

Hi, my name is Jochen Kirstätter, also known as "JoKi". I'm a [software craftsman](https://github.com/jochenkirstaetter), [blogger](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/blog/), [community founder](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/mscc/), and [speaker](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/speaking/). The MVP award is a recognition of my community contributions and activities to engage with Microsoft services and products over years. I founded the now largest IT community in Mauritius, and organise the annual Developers Conference.

## Mauritius Software Craftsmanship Community

The [MSCC](https://jochen.kirstaetter.name/mscc/) was founded back in May 2013 when my daily job as well as my private life allowed me to have a bit of spare time, and my passion to share knowledge and information with like-minded geeks came together. Since then the community has grown as the largest and most active user group in Mauritius. We organise the [annual Developers Conference](https://conference.mscc.mu/), run monthly [meetings on various topics](https://meetup.com/MauritiusSoftwareCraftsmanshipCommunity/), and constantly encourage young and old people to venture into the world of information technology.

## GDG Mauritius

The [GDG Mauritius](https://www.meetup.com/GDG-Mauritius/) was an idea that kept me thinking about since 2015. During the first annual Developers Conference I was hoping that there would be other Google geeks to probably kick off a local GDG chapter. Unfortunately, it do not happen back then. Back in June 2017 I applied for and founded the GDG Mauritius given that my interest in Google technologies was ever increasing and I felt the need to balance the emphasis on Microsoft technologies.
